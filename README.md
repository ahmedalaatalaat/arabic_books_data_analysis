## ðŸ’¾ Phase 1: Data Collection:
In this phase, I wanted to scrape Goodreads using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. However, I couldn't find a structure for the site or proper filters to extract the data, so I came up with the idea of using the ISBN, which is unique to each book, to obtain the book information. To do that, I needed to collect the ISBNs for Arabic books, so I decided to scrape both Neelwfrat and Diwan bookstores to gather all the ISBNs for the Arabic books. Once I collected the ISBNs, I was able to scrape the books from Goodreads using Selenium to automate the search for each ISBN and obtain the book information.
